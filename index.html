            The Crescendo App features the ability for musical artists to create
            their own website. Users can submit images, videos, songs, upcoming
            shows, and social media links to help engage fans of their music.
            Fans can also sign up for the artist's mailing list. The target
            audience for the Crescendo App is musicians. After having created my
            own personal website for my music I felt it would be useful to
            provide a free website builder for other musicians to utilize. I am
            expanding this application.

            The Ghost Pavilion App was created as a personal website for my
            music project. The app allows fans of my music to sign up for a
            mailing list, see upcoming shows, listen to our music, and watch
            videos. Fans can also access a number of social media links. The
            target audience for the Ghost Pavilion App is fans of my music. I
            felt it was important for fans of my music to have a centralized
            website to peruse through, with recent updates regarding shows and
            music releases.

            The Climate Change App was created to display the effects of climate
            change. Users can enter in a city or click one of the markers within
            a Google map to show the projected max tempuratures within the
            continental United States. The map details projected tempuratures in
            Fahrenheit. The target audience for the Climate Change App is the
            general public. I felt it was important for people to know how
            serious of an issue climate change is by demonstrating their local
            temperture increase over time.

          his interest grew into a passion. James thrives working on a team and
          craves the knowledge of other developers.
